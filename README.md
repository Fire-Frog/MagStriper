=======

MagStriper is software for magnetic stripe readers & writers. The tools that ship with most magnetic stripe readers, writers, and encoders are generally Windows-only and pretty crufty.

The software features read, write, duplicate, and erase support for MSR206-compatible readers and writers (including MSRW MSR606, MSR505C, MSR106, MSR406, MSR210, MSR210U, and others).
